"""Five kinds of node agree on DigiDollar accounting, and reorgs across Thaw Day return to the same figures.

One regtest chain is built with DigiDollar active from height 200 and Thaw Day
at height 300. It carries mints below and above Thaw Day, DigiDollar sends, one
ordinary redemption and one emergency redemption, so the number of tokens left
in circulation is deliberately smaller than the amount originally minted
against the vaults that are still open.

Five nodes are then compared at one named block hash:

  0  continuous  - mined the chain and was never restarted
  1  restarted   - plain restart, no reindex
  2  reindexed   - restarted with -reindex, so it validated the whole history again
  3  fresh sync  - started from an empty directory and downloaded everything
  4  pruned      - runs with -prune, which also turns off both optional indexes

The comparison reads the accounting twice on every node. Once from
getprotectionstatus, which takes the numbers from the chainstate and the
next block's quote and never looks at the statistics index, and once from
getdigidollarstats, which may read that index. Matching statistics totals on
their own would not be evidence, because the index is a separate copy of the
numbers. The number of tokens in circulation is checked on its own, because it
is a different total from the open-vault principal and does not have to equal
it.

The last part rewinds the chain three ways - to a tip above Thaw Day, to
exactly the Thaw Day block, and back below Thaw Day - restarts the node while
it is rewound, then puts the blocks back and checks every figure returns to
what it was.
