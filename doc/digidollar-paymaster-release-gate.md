# DigiDollar Paymaster V1 release gate

This matrix maps the 28 normative acceptance criteria in
[`DIGIDOLLAR_PAYMASTER_NETWORK_PROPOSAL_EN.md`](../DIGIDOLLAR_PAYMASTER_NETWORK_PROPOSAL_EN.md)
and the post-proposal adversarial-counterparty hardening to their verification
surfaces. It is an audit aid, not a substitute for a clean release build and
test run.

> **Current gate: LOCAL CANDIDATE VERIFICATION COMPLETE — RELEASE APPROVAL
> PENDING.** On the 2026-07-30 working-tree candidate, the MSVC Debug and
> Release core targets, Release Qt targets, complete 3,605-case Debug and
> Release suites, focused Paymaster/wallet tests, provider/readiness functional
> tests in both configurations, all eight native Qt 5.15.10 suites, and the
> same-revision WSL Clang ASan/UBSan/libFuzzer checks passed. Both official
> v9.26.5/current wallet-file compatibility variants and the official
> v9.26.5/current mixed-node Paymaster relay scenario subsequently passed on
> 2026-08-08. This is not a release approval or security proof: real-Tor
> deployment and independent review remain open.

Status meanings:

- **Covered**: implementation and a focused automated test exist; this does not
  imply that the test passed on the current source tree.
- **Candidate pass**: the listed in-tree acceptance checks passed on the dated
  working-tree candidate; this does not by itself satisfy an unlisted release
  gate.
- **Partial**: important coverage exists, but the listed test gap remains.
- **External**: verification requires binaries or environments outside one
  in-tree test process.

The last column records the gate originally associated with each criterion.
The local MSVC, functional, broad-regression, Qt, and same-revision WSL reruns
covered by the 2026-07-30 matrix are satisfied for that working-tree candidate.
Real-Tor deployment and independent-review requirements remain open. Official
v9.26.5/current wallet-file, mixed-node relay, old-only bridge, and unchanged-
datadir upgrade compatibility all have current passing evidence. The historical
snapshot records only superseded pre-hardening states.

| # | Coverage status | Coverage or historical evidence | Original/remaining release gate |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Covered | `wallet_paymaster_provider.py` completes a USER_PAID transfer from a client with no DGB. | Final functional rerun. |
| 2 | Covered | Paymaster PSBT and wallet tests verify role-scoped signing and never transfer wallet secrets. | Final focused unit run. |
| 3 | Covered | Provider/directory tests verify disjoint admission proofs; the provider functional test exercises separate admission and operational pools. | Final focused unit and functional run. |
| 4 | Covered | Fee-boundary and transaction-builder tests cover carrier fees from 0.01 through 0.99 DD. | Final focused unit run. |
| 5 | Covered | Client selection tests use exact rounded totals and deterministic local sorting; `wallet_paymaster_offer_selection.py` additionally exposes differently priced offers from two independent provider daemons, applies monotonic repricing, expires stale announcements, and accepts a fresh replacement. | Final focused unit run and the registered multi-provider functional run. |
| 6 | Covered | PSBT tests prove the user and provider sign only their own inputs. | Final focused unit run. |
| 7 | Covered | Template-binding tests reject mutations and require a newly verified attempt for provider-dependent fallback changes. | Final focused unit run. |
| 8 | Covered | Persistent request IDs, monotonic attempt state, same-input recovery, and duplicate-payment guards are tested. `wallet_paymaster_failover.py` additionally proves the exact reserved DD input set survives a real provider change and produces one payment. | Crash-specific variants are tracked under 22 and 23. |
| 9 | Covered | A three-node functional rerun on 2026-08-08 used the official v9.26.5 daemon: the old node accepted the Paymaster-created transaction in its mempool and validated it in the same block/tip as the upgraded nodes. The unchanged-datadir upgrade and old-only bridge scenarios also passed against that official daemon on 2026-08-09. | Satisfied by the official v9.26.5/current functional reruns. |
| 10 | Covered | Paymaster code is outside consensus and consensus validation remains unchanged. | Final diff review and broad consensus regression run. |
| 11 | Covered | Reputation tests cover local-only storage, neutral failures, cooldown, and security-first eligibility. | Final focused unit run. |
| 12 | Covered | Headless selection, fee caps, durable sessions, and request-id idempotency are covered by client/store and provider functional tests. | Final focused and functional run. |
| 13 | Covered | Legacy `senddigidollar` without options remains on the wallet-funded path and has regression coverage. | Final broad wallet regression run. |
| 14 | Covered | The provider functional test completes public and restricted zero-service-fee sponsorship with the common protocol. | Final functional rerun. |
| 15 | Covered | Capability tests bind restricted authorization to the payment, store only its hash, reject reuse, and keep it out of gossip. | Final focused and functional run. |
| 16 | Covered | Builder tests require fresh internal DD/DGB change; the provider functional test scans production logs for payment artifacts and secrets. | Final functional rerun with `debug=net,rpc`. |
| 17 | Covered | Readiness tests enforce onion-only high privacy, Tor isolation, one attempt, and no v1/clearnet fallback. | Perform a deployment smoke test with a real Tor proxy/onion service. |
| 18 | Covered | `wallet_paymaster_offer_selection.py` proves automatic cheapest-provider selection and no mutation at the unselected provider. `wallet_paymaster_failover.py` adds two-client contention for one cheap operational slot and sequential completion through the standby provider. | Repeat both registered multi-provider functional tests on the release build. |
| 19 | Covered | Store tests cover retention redaction, tombstones, idempotency, mempool observation, confirmation, and reorg handling. `wallet_paymaster_reorg.py` adds a real longer-chain rollback/reconfirmation of client state, provider finance, and successor liquidity. | Final focused unit and registered reorg functional run. |
| 20 | Covered | Documentation states the pseudonymity boundary; the Qt privacy selector carries the same warning, and its assertion passed with Qt 5.15.10. | Final broad Qt regression run. |
| 21 | Covered | Recovery tests cover recheck, exact retry, same-input fallback/self-return, durable locks, and confirmation-dependent cancellation finality. The functional failover test pins both safe pre-signature fallback and rejection after a user PSBT exists. | Crash-specific variants remain under 22 and 23. |
| 22 | Covered | Every provider-commit write and the commit operation have deterministic rollback injection; a reopened post-commit snapshot contains the exact raw transaction, bindings, pool state, sponsorship state, and `PENDING_NETWORK` subphase used by retry/broadcast recovery. | Final focused and functional rerun. |
| 23 | Covered | Every user-authorization write and the commit operation have deterministic rollback injection; a reopened successful snapshot contains the exact persisted user-signed PSBT hash, attempt, authorization, and `USER_SIGNATURE_SENT` subphase without another variant. | Final focused and functional rerun. |
| 24 | Covered | Request parsing, analysis, builder, and boundary tests enforce one recipient and the 100–10,000,000-cent bounds on every DD output. The `paymaster_wire_envelopes` target completed 100,000 ASan/UBSan/libFuzzer runs after its timestamp-overflow finding was fixed and replayed successfully. | Final focused unit run. |
| 25 | Covered | Readiness tests enforce unpruned, txindex-complete client/provider operation. The official-v9.26.5 leaf scenario proves old-node validation of the ordinary final transaction. On 2026-08-09 `p2p_paymaster_v9_26_5_bridge.py` additionally passed ordinary DGB/DD relay across an old-only bridge while Paymaster discovery failed closed until a direct current link existed. | Satisfied by the official v9.26.5 leaf and bridge runs. |
| 26 | Covered | Signed monotonic `PMRESULT` and one commit key/raw transaction are tested; deterministic failure at each atomic provider-commit write and at commit proves complete rollback of the commit, sponsorship, pool, attempt, and session records. | Final focused unit run. |
| 27 | Covered | Store/RPC tests distinguish mempool from confirmation and expose the shared state/finality fields; Qt renders those fields. | Final RPC and Qt regression run. |
| 28 | Covered | Locked-wallet tests pause the same session without fallback, and provider policy requires a positive absolute DGB network-fee cap. | Final focused and functional run. |

## Adversarial-counterparty hardening gate

These checks extend, rather than replace, the 28 proposal criteria. A release
must demonstrate the invariant that once an honest side signs, every movement
of its own DD or DGB exactly matches its locally persisted authorization
manifest.

| ID | Current status | Implementation/coverage surface | Required acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Candidate pass | Protocol V5 requires `PMCAPREQ`/`PMCAPRESP`; the client validates provider identity, BIP86 control proofs, creating transactions, live Chainstate resources, reference block, nonce, request/session binding, and expiry before disclosing intent or capability. Validated resources are persisted and bound to the later quote. | Malicious-provider tests for foreign/spent/double-promised resources, bad control proofs, stale references, quote/resource mismatch, reconnect, and explicit no-downgrade behavior. |
| H2 | Candidate pass | `ClientAuthorizationManifest` and `ProviderAuthorizationManifest` are built from local authority and revalidated by the shared core immediately before client/provider signature, retry, recovery, and broadcast. Unknown PSBT fields, roles, outputs, and non-default sighashes fail closed. | Mutation matrix for inputs, outputs, amounts, recipients, fees, change ownership, PSBT fields, roles, sighashes, policy, capacity, and template commitments through RPC, Qt, and background paths. |
| H3 | Candidate pass | Final processing reconstructs the trusted PSBT, checks raw/non-witness transaction, txid, wtxid, exact inputs/outputs/all witnesses, runs the script interpreter with actual prevouts, and performs a mempool preflight when needed. Final state is monotonic and result/attempt/session writes are atomic. The registered functional reorg rolls one real final transaction back and reconfirms the same txid without a duplicate finance event. | Invalid-witness, same-txid/different-witness, mempool-conflict, late-result, replay, reorg, restart, failure-injection, and immutable-final-state tests. |
| H4 | Candidate pass | `ProviderSafetyPolicy` and `ProviderBudgetReservation` apply finite per-model transaction/reserved/hour/day fee and completion limits plus active-quote and request limits. Quote reserve, final spend, and safe release are atomic; ledger and accounting-time high-water survive restart. The functional contention case holds the only cheap slot for one client while a second safely moves to the standby provider. | Last-budget/last-slot races, concurrent quotes, clock rollback, crash at every write, restart, expiry, public-sponsorship drain, and balance-oracle tests proving no overspend. |
| H5 | Candidate pass | `ClientSafetyPolicy` durably limits service fee per transfer and rolling day; the effective cap is the minimum of wallet policy, RPC limit, and signed offer. | Per-transfer/daily boundary, concurrent reservation, policy change, restart, exact retry, rejection without policy, and RPC/Qt parity tests. |
| H6 | Candidate pass | Semantic replay keys are independent of peer ID; exact retries are idempotent and conflicting content is rejected. The first valid signed Capacity/quote claim is staged evidence-only before ACK/deep validation, with persisted-authority failures kept distinct from invalid remote artifacts. Generation-bound RAII leases protect inbox ownership across the database boundary. Critical replay state persists. Token buckets cover peer/netgroup/provider/session, work is fairly queued, cheap announcement/rate checks precede crypto, TTL math saturates, and signed equivocation evidence locally blocks the provider. | Cross-peer/reconnect/restart replay, DB-write failure and retry, lease overlap/ABA, exact request/session binding, queue fairness, netgroup/announcement flood, expiry race, sequential and simultaneous conflicting Capacity/quote, persistent block, and timestamp/amount boundary fuzz tests. |
| H7 | Candidate pass | `resolvepaymastersession ... cancel_to_self` can use a distinct `USER_PAID` provider that passes Capacity V5. The recovery manifest permits only the original user inputs, fresh wallet-owned DD returns, a locally capped recovery fee, and recovery-provider DGB inputs. | End-to-end recovery without client DGB, same-provider rejection, privacy inheritance, malicious outputs/fees, ambiguous original broadcast race, restart, exact retry, and confirmation-dependent release tests. |
| H8 | Candidate pass | Stateful fuzz targets cover Capacity → Intent → Quote → Submit → Result → Recovery; focused wallet/P2P tests cover manifests, budgets, replay, and finality. On 2026-07-30 the exact synchronized candidate was rebuilt with Clang ASan/UBSan/libFuzzer, all saved artifacts/corpora replayed successfully, and both fresh targets completed 100,000 runs. | Repeat this matrix after any affected source, build, or dependency change. |

## Current candidate verification (2026-07-30)

These results apply to the current uncommitted working-tree candidate, not to a
tagged or reproducibly built release artifact:

| Surface | Verified result |
|---|---|
| MSVC Debug | `test_digibyte`, `digibyted`, and `digibyte-cli` built successfully. The 16 focused Paymaster suites plus `walletload_tests` passed 196/196, and the complete suite passed 3,605/3,605 with exit code 0. The MSVC Debug CRT still emits its known process-shutdown allocation dump after the successful result; this remains diagnostic follow-up rather than a hidden test failure. |
| MSVC Release | `test_digibyte`, `digibyted`, `digibyte-cli`, `digibyte-qt`, and `test_digibyte-qt` built successfully. The focused Paymaster plus `walletload_tests` selection passed 196/196, and the complete core suite passed 3,605/3,605 with exit code 0. |
| Functional Debug | `wallet_paymaster_provider.py` and `wallet_paymaster_readiness.py` completed successfully against the Debug candidate. Explicit safe port seeds avoided locally reserved Windows TCP ranges. |
| Functional Release | `wallet_paymaster_provider.py` and `wallet_paymaster_readiness.py` completed successfully against the Release candidate. |
| Current multi-provider selection | On 2026-08-08 the registered `wallet_paymaster_offer_selection.py --descriptors` scenario passed all 17 framework unit tests and its 1/1 functional test in 27 seconds. Two independent current-version provider daemons advertised 50-bps and 200-bps USER_PAID offers to a DGB-less client; the client ordered both exact totals, selected only the cheaper provider, completed and confirmed one transfer, and left the expensive provider's pool, safety budget, and finance ledger unchanged. |
| Extended current multi-provider/reorg checks | On 2026-08-08 one registered local Windows `test_runner.py --jobs=1` invocation passed all 17 framework unit tests plus `wallet_paymaster_offer_selection.py --descriptors` in 21 seconds, `wallet_paymaster_failover.py --descriptors` in 47 seconds, and `wallet_paymaster_reorg.py --descriptors` in 9 seconds (77 seconds accumulated). The same registered group then passed under x86_64 WSL with all 17 framework tests and durations of 12, 24, and 3 seconds (39 seconds accumulated). The scenarios cover monotonic repricing and expiry/refresh; one-slot contention, same-input standby fallback, post-signature rejection, and exact single-provider accounting; plus finance/pool rollback and same-txid reconfirmation. |
| Official v9.26.5/current compatibility | On 2026-08-08 an x86_64 WSL build ran both registered `wallet_v9_26_5_compatibility.py` variants and the three-node `wallet_paymaster_provider.py --descriptors` scenario against the official v9.26.5 Linux daemon. Each invocation passed all 17 framework unit tests. The legacy and descriptor wallet variants passed in 36 accumulated seconds; the provider scenario passed in 27 seconds after its restart path was corrected to reconnect the third node. |
| New official-v9.26.5 scenarios | On 2026-08-09 `p2p_paymaster_v9_26_5_bridge.py --descriptors` passed against the official Linux daemon in 38 seconds after all 17 framework tests passed. It relayed and confirmed ordinary DGB and DD through the old-only bridge, proved through raw message capture that the old node received but did not relay `pmannounce`, failed Paymaster selection closed, and restored discovery over a direct current-current link. `wallet_v9_26_5_inplace_upgrade.py --descriptors` subsequently passed in 7 seconds after all 17 framework tests passed. It created encrypted v9.26.5 wallets, two active positions, and isolated pending DGB/DD transfers; loaded the exact datadir's blocks, Chainstate, txindex, and mempool with the current daemon while wallets were disabled; then loaded, reannounced, confirmed, spent, redeemed, and restarted the inherited wallet state. |
| Native Qt | Qt 5.15.10 was rebuilt and installed with the bundled-zlib namespace backport. Inspection found the three affected `z_crc32_combine_*` symbols prefixed and no conflicting unprefixed definitions in `Qt5Core.lib`; the Release Qt targets linked and all eight registered suites completed with exit code 0. |
| WSL2 sanitizers/fuzzing | The synchronized 2026-07-30 source candidate rebuilt successfully with Clang `-fsanitize=address,fuzzer,undefined`. One saved wire artifact plus the 710-file wire and 2,365-file stateful corpora replayed successfully. Fresh `paymaster_wire_envelopes` and `paymaster_stateful_security` campaigns each completed 100,000 executions with exit code 0. Wire added 289 units in 12 seconds at 373 MB peak RSS; stateful added 628 units in 2,004 seconds at 562 MB peak RSS. |

Any source, build, or dependency change that can affect a verification surface
invalidates that surface's dated evidence and requires the affected checks to
be repeated.

## Required closing sequence

Steps 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 have current-candidate evidence above. Step 3 has
passing local and WSL evidence, but still requires the listed release-build
rerun. Steps 7 and 9 remain open. Completed steps must be repeated after any
affected source, build, or dependency change.

1. **Current candidate complete — final review:** The final Paymaster security
   diff was reviewed for consensus isolation, protocol V5/no-downgrade,
   manifest call-site completeness, atomic wallet writes, finite limits, and
   absence of raw IP/payment material in persistent rate/accounting keys. No
   obvious release-blocking counterparty theft path was found; this does not
   replace the independent review in step 9.
2. **Current candidate complete — MSVC:** Build `test_digibyte`, `digibyted`, and `digibyte-cli` with MSVC in Debug and
   Release. Run the complete focused Paymaster unit/wallet suites in both
   configurations, including malicious-counterparty, expiry, replay,
   last-budget/slot, crash, restart, and final-witness regressions.
3. **Current candidate extended locally — functional:** Run
   `wallet_paymaster_provider.py`, `wallet_paymaster_offer_selection.py`,
   `wallet_paymaster_failover.py`, `wallet_paymaster_reorg.py`, and
   `wallet_paymaster_readiness.py` with
   candidate binaries. The provider scenario must cover USER_PAID, public and
   restricted SPONSORED, finite budgets, drain-only completion, distinct-provider
   no-client-DGB recovery, restart, exact retry, capability replay, and balance
   invariants. The selection scenario must expose two differently priced offers
   from independent provider daemons, choose the lowest exact total without a
   provider override, and leave the unselected provider untouched. On
   2026-08-08 the newly registered descriptor selection scenario passed its
   17 framework unit tests and 1/1 functional test in 27 seconds. The extended
   selection, failover/contention, and reorg scripts subsequently passed one
   registered local current-build `test_runner.py` run including all 17
   framework unit tests; repeat it on the release build before closing this
   step.
4. **Current candidate complete — official
   v9.26.5/current compatibility:** On
   2026-08-08 both registered variants of
   `wallet_v9_26_5_compatibility.py` passed against the official v9.26.5 Linux
   daemon. The run covered raw legacy and descriptor wallet-directory loading
   without an explicit upgrade, encryption and wallet state across restart,
   post-load signing and spending, active DD records in the descriptor wallet,
   and reopening in v9.26.5 after current-version use without Paymaster. Both
   versions sent and received DGB directly, and the descriptor wallets sent and
   received DD directly. The test also required cross-version address
   validation, both-mempool relay with identical raw transaction bytes,
   confirmation by the receiving version, and exact amount/direction history
   after restart. The three-node `wallet_paymaster_provider.py --descriptors`
   scenario also passed with the official v9.26.5 daemon: the Paymaster result
   remained an ordinary `DD_TX_TRANSFER`, reached the old node's mempool with
   identical raw bytes, was validated in the same block/tip, and no Paymaster
   announcement was received or sent by the old node.
   `p2p_paymaster_v9_26_5_bridge.py --descriptors` now covers the old-only P2P
   bridge and passed against the official daemon on 2026-08-09.
   `wallet_v9_26_5_inplace_upgrade.py --descriptors` adds the unchanged-datadir
   pending-state/redeem path and also passed against the official daemon on
   2026-08-09.
5. **Current candidate complete — Qt 5.15.10:** Build and run the complete native Qt 5.15.10 suite, including client/provider
   safety-policy RPC parity, authorization confirmation, warning persistence,
   recovery, and authoritative finality rendering.
6. **Current candidate complete — WSL2:** The exact synchronized candidate was
   rebuilt in WSL2/Ubuntu with Clang/libFuzzer plus ASan/UBSan. Saved artifacts
   and both corpora replayed successfully; fresh `paymaster_wire_envelopes` and
   stateful Capacity → Recovery campaigns each completed 100,000 runs with
   clean exit codes.
7. **Open — real Tor deployment:** Exercise high-privacy mode against a real Tor proxy and onion service,
   including stream isolation, `-logips=0`, capture rejection, one-attempt
   enforcement, and no clearnet/v1 fallback.
8. **Current candidate complete — broad local regressions:** The complete MSVC
   Debug and Release core suites each passed 3,605/3,605, and the complete
   native Qt suite passed all eight registered suites. Platform- or
   configuration-specific release matrices beyond these local surfaces remain
   separate release-review responsibilities.
9. **Open — independent review:** Have the counterparty model, manifest and
   budget invariants, and race/crash behavior assessed independently. Until
   this is completed or explicitly dispositioned by release review, the
   implementation must not be described as formally proven or independently
   audited.

## Historical verification snapshot (2026-07-28; superseded)

The following results are retained for provenance only. They predate the
adversarial-counterparty hardening and **do not satisfy the current gate**:

- MSVC Debug and Release core builds passed; the test project used `/bigobj`
  for existing large DigiDollar test translation units.
- The then-current focused Paymaster unit set reported 75/75 passing in Debug
  and Release.
- The then-current provider/readiness functional tests and frozen/current
  mixed-version runs reported passing.
- The then-current native Qt 5.15.10 targeted and complete suites reported
  passing exit codes.
- `paymaster_wire_envelopes` first found a signed timestamp overflow. After the
  corresponding saturating-time fix, its saved artifact and a fresh 100,000-run
  ASan/UBSan campaign reported success.
- Python syntax checks and `git diff --check` reported success.
- A broad Release run that excluded separately tracked BIP324 vectors was not
  clean: it reported network-dependent oracle, DigiDollar performance, RBF, and
  Windows command-text failures. That historical disposition remains context,
  not a waiver for the new common-revision rerun.
