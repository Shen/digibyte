DigiByte Core version 9.26.6rc2
============================

RC2 is a candidate for coordinated node and wallet testing. It replaces RC1,
which could reject a valid DigiDollar mint block during a reindex on a node
that holds a DigiDollar wallet. It is not the final v9.26.6 release. Activation
settings are listed below; installing a candidate does not change heights
already built into it.

The release repairs identified crash and hang defects, improves DigiDollar
redemption and amount handling, and corrects wallet displays. Feather reduces
memory use by keeping less-used block header fields on disk and removing
repeated startup work. Memory use and startup time depend on the chain,
hardware, and options. See [the RAM explanation](../RAM_IMPROVE.md) for the
design and measured results.

Saved transaction fee estimates now load correctly after a restart. The node
keeps its learned fee history instead of discarding its own saved file.

It also adds Thaw Day. Thaw Day is a single block height, one per network, at
which a set of DigiDollar rule changes takes effect together. **Mainnet is
scheduled at 24,490,000**, estimated for November 1, 2026. **Testnet26 is
scheduled at 432,100**, estimated for September 18–19, 2026. Block heights
trigger the changes. Signet is unsupported and remains unscheduled. Installing
this software before a network's height does not activate its rules early.

Changes since RC1
=================

### Paymaster additions on the integration branch

The following Paymaster changes describe `integration/paymaster-v9.26.6rc2`
through `a4f17f6315`; they are not a claim that the upstream RC2 artifacts
include this feature. Release acceptance remains open.

Paymaster integrations can query wallet-local support and readiness through
`getpaymasterclientinfo`. Session responses provide separate read-only recipient
payment and recovery observations. Paymaster `senddigidollar` reports success
only after validated local recipient confirmation; `final` continues to describe
terminal session state, including failure and cancellation. Qt keeps submitted
payments pending until confirmation. Missing/pruned evidence does not prove a
payment. Terminal retries now validate the complete existing order hash; after
pruning, send replay requires the original input set or returns an explicit
unavailable-details error. Status inspection remains available.

The existing daily service-fee limit now counts open reservations regardless of
age. The interfaces support a possible x402 extension without committing to its
implementation. This package adds no x402 adapter, agent budget, payment RPC,
persistent record format, wallet feature flag, or Paymaster wire/consensus change. See the
[client integration contract](digidollar-paymaster-integration.md) for units,
side effects, retry behavior, versioning and remaining validation gates.

Finite pool setup separately uses maintenance journal V4, retaining explicit
V3 read compatibility without new setup authority. Do not confuse that earlier
change with the client package's unchanged session/tombstone formats. Current
verification commands are in the [build/test runbook](digidollar-paymaster-testing.md).

### Upstream RC2 changes

**Block validation no longer reads the wallet's script table.** The node keeps
an in-memory table that the wallet and the transaction builder fill in with the
DigiDollar amount behind each output script. The table is keyed by the script
alone, so when a DigiDollar owner address is used again, only the last amount
stays. Change from a send goes back to the address that held the spent token,
so any wallet that has ever sent DigiDollar has such an address.

In RC1, block validation below Thaw Day read that table before the chain data.
A mainnet RC1 node holding a wallet that had minted $100 and later held $98 of
change at the same address rejected block 23,869,549, the first DigiDollar mint
block, with `bad-dd-mint-amount` while reindexing. It then marked every later
block invalid and stopped following the chain. Nodes without such a wallet
accepted the same block, so the answer depended on the local wallet rather than
on the chain.

Block and mempool validation now read DigiDollar amounts from the chain only:
the mint or redeem record in the transaction itself, or the transaction that
created a token output. The table is left for the wallet and for unit tests.
The Thaw Day heights and rules are unchanged, and the chain that exists today is
what nodes without the wallet table already accepted, so this repairs a local
defect and does not change the rules.

**If an RC1 node is stuck below a block it wrongly rejected**, install RC2,
start the node, and tell it to look at that block again:

```
digibyte-cli reconsiderblock 00000000000000052cc3d211b3d16196a3585d46474202dfa42e9f770d02e9bd
```

The node then validates the remaining blocks and catches up without another
full reindex. A fresh `-reindex` on RC2 also works and takes longer. Until you
have upgraded, do not start `-reindex` on an RC1 node that holds a DigiDollar
wallet.

**A wallet message no longer fills the log once per block.** During a reindex or
a first sync the wallet logged "ReconcilePositionStates skipped while chainstate
is not ready" for every block, which produced an 8 GB log on one mainnet
reindex. The line now appears only with `-debug=digidollar`.

**Tests.** A unit test suite writes wrong amounts into the table and checks that
mint validation, vault detection and the amount reader answer from chain data. A
functional test mints, pays the mint address again, and then reorgs and
reindexes with the wallet loaded. Both fail on RC1 and pass on RC2.


Read this first
===============

Three things change what you can run or what your scripts must send. Read all
three before you upgrade.

1. A pruned mainnet node cannot run at the smallest setting
-----------------------------------------------------------

A node has to keep the DigiDollar part of the chain. When a DigiDollar coin is
spent, the node reads the block that created it to find out how much it is worth
and how long it is locked. A pruned node has no transaction index, so the only
place to read that from is the block itself. Any block from the DigiDollar
activation height upward can hold one, so all of them have to stay on disk.

On mainnet that floor is height **23,627,520**. Everything from there to the tip
is kept. Everything below it can still be deleted.

At height 24,195,289, which was the tip on 12 September 2026, that is about
568,000 blocks. It grows by 5,760 blocks a day, because a block takes 15
seconds. The rest of the chain, about 97 per cent of it by block count, can
still be deleted. **Pruning still works. `-prune=550` cannot be honoured.**

How much disk that is has not been measured on a real node. As an estimate from
the average block size of the whole chain, about 1.2 kB, those 568,000 blocks
come to roughly 0.7 GB, growing by about 7 MB a day. Undo data is kept for the
same window and adds to it. Recent blocks are larger than the chain average, so
treat 0.7 GB as a floor, not an answer.

**What to do.** Before you upgrade, set `-prune` to a few gigabytes rather than
550. Start the node, let it run for a day, then read `size_on_disk` and
`pruneheight` from `getblockchaininfo` and set the target from the real number.

This constraint is not new in v9.26.6. It arrived with DigiDollar and is already
in v9.26.5. What is new here is that the floor is now held correctly. Before
this release, a reorg on a node whose tip was still below the floor dragged the
floor down to the height of the disconnected block and left it there until the
next restart, after which the node stopped pruning above that point. A pruned
node doing initial block download hit that on the first reorg it saw. That is
fixed.

**If your node has already pruned DigiDollar-era blocks, it will not start.**
It stops with a message telling you to restore the missing block and undo files
or download that part of the chain again. This check is not new either, but it
is the failure an operator is most likely to meet, so it is worth saying plainly.
A node that has kept every block at or above the floor is not affected by this
missing-history check.

**A node that cannot meet its prune target does not say so.** It keeps the
blocks it must keep, goes over the target you set, and writes nothing that tells
you why. This is known and is not fixed in this release. If your disk use is
above your target, this is the reason.

2. Six DigiDollar commands no longer guess cents or dollars
-------------------------------------------------------------

`senddigidollar`, `sendmanydigidollar`, `redeemdigidollar` and
`getredemptioninfo` used to work out whether a number meant cents or dollars
from the shape of the number. `10000` meant 10,000 cents, which is $100.00.
`10000.00` meant $10,000.00, which is a hundred times more. A habitual decimal
point moved a hundred times the intended amount, and the node did it without a
word.

They now take the unit with the amount:

- **A whole number with no unit still means cents.** `10000` is $100.00, exactly
  as before. Anything already sending whole numbers of cents needs no change.
- **A number with a decimal point and no unit is refused.** Nothing is sent,
  redeemed or changed. The error is:
  `ambiguous amount: pass amount_unit=cents or amount_unit=dollars (an amount
  with a decimal point is not accepted without a unit)`
- **`amount_unit="cents"`** requires a whole number. `"10.00"` is refused.
- **`amount_unit="dollars"`** allows at most two decimal places. `"12.34"` is
  1,234 cents. `"12"` is 1,200 cents. `"12.345"` is refused.

The new argument goes last:

```
senddigidollar <address> <amount> [comment] [fee_rate] [selected_inputs] [amount_unit]
sendmanydigidollar <dummy> <amounts> [comment] [selected_inputs] [amount_unit]
redeemdigidollar <position_id> <dd_amount> [redemption_address] [fee_rate] [amount_unit]
getredemptioninfo <position_id> [dd_amount] [amount_unit]
```

Two more take it for the amounts they filter on, rather than an amount they
send:

```
listdigidollarpositions [active_only] [tier_filter] [min_amount] [count] [skip] [amount_unit]
listdigidollaraddresses [include_watchonly] [min_balance] [include_empty] [amount_unit]
```

Both of these send $250.00:

```
digibyte-cli senddigidollar "<DigiDollar address>" 25000
digibyte-cli -named senddigidollar address="<DigiDollar address>" amount="250.00" amount_unit="dollars"
```

**Anything automated against these four commands has to be checked before you
upgrade.** If it sends whole numbers of cents, it keeps working. If it sends
decimals, it stops working until you add `amount_unit="dollars"`. It fails
loudly rather than moving the wrong amount, which is the point of the change.

Two list filters take the same argument for the same reason: `min_amount` on
`listdigidollarpositions` and `min_balance` on `listdigidollaraddresses`. A
negative value in either used to be accepted and then ignored; it is now
refused. `getredemptioninfo` now applies the same $100,000 limit that
`redeemdigidollar` applies, so asking about a redemption and doing it give the
same answer.

`mintdigidollar` is unchanged. It has always taken whole cents only.

3. Thaw Day activation settings
--------------------------------------------

Thaw Day uses one height per network:

| Network | Height in this candidate | Estimated date |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Mainnet | **24,490,000** | November 1, 2026 |
| Testnet26 | **432,100** | September 18–19, 2026 |
| Signet (unsupported) | Not scheduled | None |
| Regtest | Not scheduled unless configured | Local test setting |

The height is the trigger. Dates are estimates that change with the block rate.
Only a private regtest chain can set a runtime height with
`-ddthawdayheight=N`. On any public network that option is a startup error.
The one height on each network selects all intended Thaw Day rule changes
together. Blocks below it keep their existing rules.

Publish the tagged source, binaries, checksums and activation heights at least
14 days before mainnet activation and at least 3 days before testnet activation.
The current testnet estimate requires distribution by the evening of
September 15, 2026, in America/Boise. The selected height is expected on
September 18–19, before the September 21 target. Recheck the block rate during
the upgrade window. Coordinate upgrades with miners, oracles, exchanges and
full-node operators. Scheduling the height does not establish that everyone
has upgraded or that release checks have passed.

If the upgrade window or required checks cannot be met, coordinate a replacement
release before the scheduled height to postpone or disable activation.
Operators must install the replacement before the old height. An announcement
alone cannot change an installed binary's height. See
[node operations](digidollar-operations.md) for upgrade and recovery steps.


How to upgrade
==============

Shut the old version down and wait until it has fully stopped. This can take a
few minutes. Then run the installer on Windows, or copy over
`/Applications/DigiByte-Qt` on macOS, or `digibyted` and `digibyte-qt` on Linux.

A reindex is **not** required. The wallet file format has not changed. Back up
your wallets before you upgrade, as you would for any upgrade, and keep the
backups you already have.

If you prune, read section 1 above first and raise the setting.

Older wallets still open. Minting a new DigiDollar needs a descriptor wallet
with private keys, HD support, a Taproot receiving descriptor and a bech32
change descriptor. A wallet that cannot mint may still send and redeem existing
DigiDollar if it has the keys needed to sign those transactions. Wallets with
private keys disabled cannot send or redeem. The wallet now explains minting
eligibility before requesting the passphrase.


Thaw Day
========

Thaw Day is one block height per network. At and above it, three DigiDollar
rules change together:

- **Minting uses a price taken from the chain**, not from each node's own
  running volatility state. The block's committed oracle quote is compared with
  the lower median of the nearest 15 eligible prices between 240 and 1,440
  blocks back. Transfers and redemptions stop using the old volatility freeze.
- **Health is measured from open vaults**, and those totals are stored in the
  coin database with the rest of chain state, so they survive a restart and are
  rebuilt the same way on every node.
- **A vault has one identity** that every node derives the same way.

The height of the block being checked decides which rules apply to it. The new
rules use that block's ancestry and coin state during normal operation, reindex
and reorgs. Blocks below Thaw Day keep their existing validation rules.

You can see the status at any time:

```
digibyte-cli getdigidollardeploymentinfo
```

The `thaw_day` object reports whether a height is scheduled, what it is, your
tip height, the next block height, and whether the rules apply at each.

**Preparing and checking the accounting takes work.** The node normally builds
the starting vault totals when it connects the block immediately before Thaw
Day, or when it starts at that height. It walks the unspent outputs while
holding the chain lock, so RPC requests needing that lock wait. Later startups
independently check the saved vault totals again. **This cost has not been
measured on a mainnet-sized coin set.** Small regtest measurements do not predict
a mainnet startup time.

An existing DigiDollar statistics index also checks its saved token supply
against unspent outputs when it first reaches Thaw Day and when it reopens
afterward. A new index can count directly from the chain as it catches up.
It compares totals for the same block and repairs an incorrect saved total.
This adds startup work. Normal block updates use each block's changes instead
of scanning the whole coin set again. Token supply and open-vault debt are
different totals; extra tokens burned during redemption can make them differ
without indicating corruption.


What changed
============

Money and safety
----------------

- **A wallet with no passphrase could replace the key that opens a vault.**
  Saving a DigiDollar owner key for a vault that already had one overwrote the
  old key without a word. The owner key is how a wallet reaches its collateral,
  so the vault would have been left with no way to open it and the collateral
  would have been stuck. Every wallet now refuses to replace an owner key with a
  different one, and says so in the log.

- **Redeeming could send a whole vault to an address nobody can spend from.** A
  redemption hands the entire vault back in its first output. When the caller
  gave no address for it, the builder made one up from the owner key. No wallet
  watches that address and no wallet can spend from it. It was reached when the
  wallet could not supply a change address and the leftover after the fee was
  too small to make a change output, so the build did not stop earlier. The
  redemption now stops with a plain error and builds no transaction.

- **A mint is written to the wallet before it is sent, not after.** A node that
  stopped in between used to leave coins locked in a vault with nothing in the
  wallet to redeem it. Every write now reports whether it worked, and nothing is
  sent if one fails. This is true from the console and from the wallet window.

- **A missing owner key is recovered, never invented.** Redeeming a vault whose
  key record has gone missing now searches the wallet's own keys, including the
  unused ones it keeps ready, and accepts only a key that reproduces the vault's
  own output on the chain. Five distinct errors replace the single "owner key
  not found", so a locked wallet, a watch-only wallet and a genuinely missing
  key can be told apart.

- **Leftover DigiByte goes to your own wallet.** In a redemption it can no
  longer follow an address you typed in, such as an exchange deposit address. If
  a mint, a send or a redemption has nowhere safe to send leftover DigiByte, it
  now stops with an error and builds nothing, rather than paying it to an
  address nobody keeps the key for.

- **`senddigidollar` and `redeemdigidollar` refuse an amount over $100,000**
  before they select a single coin. `sendmanydigidollar` already did. The limit
  applies to what you type. It never limits the burn a wallet works out for
  itself when closing a vault.

- **Redeeming works again on a wallet whose DigiByte is in many small pieces.**
  The fee used to be estimated once against a fixed 400-byte guess, and the
  redemption then failed when the real transaction cost more. It now measures
  the transaction its candidate coins would produce and asks for more until they
  cover it. If a wallet holds only coins so small that each one adds more fee
  than value, the command says so and tells you to consolidate.

- **A mint that can no longer confirm releases what it reserved.** It is
  reported as expired, and the key and the record are kept, so a reorg or a late
  block brings the vault back.

- **Two mints, or two redemptions, sent at the same instant no longer pick the
  same coins** and knock each other out.

Crashes, hangs and things that would not stop
----------------------------------------------

- **Oracle shutdown now waits for callbacks before destroying their objects.**
  It used to destroy its oracle objects as the first step of shutting down,
  while a scheduler thread was still running inside one of them. That thread
  then waited forever on a lock in freed
  memory, and when the memory was reused instead, the node crashed. On the test
  machine, 8 stops out of 30 hung on the old code. A test that stops a node
  twenty times in a row failed on every attempt: three of those runs hung and
  one ended in a segmentation fault. On the fixed code, 170 stops in a row all
  completed. A node that hangs on shutdown leaves its coin database unwritten
  and has to roll the chain forward again on the next start.

- **A crash during a reorg is fixed.** The mempool's index update was being run
  on entries belonging to the Dandelion stem pool, which wired the two pools
  into each other. The next block connect then walked a broken structure and the
  node died.

- **Three ways a node could freeze are fixed.** All three were two threads
  taking the same two locks in opposite order: the once-a-second Dandelion
  embargo check, a peer disconnecting with stem transactions still queued, and
  the inventory handler, which ran on every new connection.

- **Two more lock-order faults are fixed.** The wallet's fallback broadcast
  path, used when no Dandelion peer is available, changed the stem pool and ran
  mempool acceptance with no locks at all. And on UTXO snapshot activation the
  stem pool stayed on the old chain state. Both now take the same locks in the
  same order as every other writer.

- **The reported wallet lock-order faults are fixed.** Loading a wallet,
  importing a descriptor or a wallet file, and `rescanblockchain` used to hang a
  node that had a DigiDollar wallet, because the wallet asked the chain a
  question while holding a wallet lock and the chain was waiting for the wallet.
  Minting and redeeming had the same fault while checking that the chain had not
  moved.

- **Eight DigiDollar wallet commands now wait for the wallet to catch up with
  the newest block.** A balance asked for straight after a block is now right,
  and minting no longer fails over money that has already confirmed.

What the wallet shows you
--------------------------

- **A redemption always tells you what happened.** Every message from the redeem
  form now opens a dialog, with the transaction id, instead of going to a
  desktop notification service that may be switched off or absent. Users were
  seeing nothing at all after typing their passphrase. Every refusal from the
  mint form does the same.

- **A mint appears as a mint.** The transaction list used to show it as money
  sent away and then received back, and folded the fee into the collateral
  figure, so the wallet claimed more DigiByte was locked than really was. A mint
  now has its own row showing the DigiDollars it created, with the collateral
  and the fee on their own rows and the fee shown once.

- **DigiByte and DigiDollar amounts have separate columns.** One column used to
  hold DigiByte on some rows and dollars on others, so it could not be sorted,
  added up or exported. Each column now sorts on its own number and exports
  under its own heading.

- **The transaction details window understands DigiDollar.** It shows the
  amount, the collateral locked or returned, the lock period, the block the
  collateral unlocks at, and the vault. Where a number is genuinely not in the
  transaction it says so, instead of printing a zero that reads like a real
  amount.

- **Returned change is named correctly.** What a redemption hands back used to
  be called "Redemption Change", which says the opposite of what happens. It is
  now "DigiDollar change returned", with one sentence saying where it came from:
  the wallet spends whole DigiDollar inputs, and if they add up to more than the
  redemption burns, the extra comes back. A vault is always closed in full,
  never in part.

- **The Redeem button on a locked wallet asks for the passphrase** instead of
  being greyed out so the prompt never appeared. A wallet with no private keys
  is still refused, and now says why.

- **The send form says why it will not take an amount**, and keeps the number
  you typed instead of silently dropping the digit that would take it over the
  limit.

- **The transaction list always shows a confirmation count**, instead of
  switching to the word "Confirmed" after five, and the details window labels
  that count "Confirmations".

- **Paying DigiDollar to your own wallet no longer writes errors to the log** on
  a successful send.

Speed and memory
----------------

- **A synced mainnet node keeps about 1.5 GB less in memory, and pays about two
  and a half seconds more on startup for it.** Every block header the node held
  carried an array of eight pointers, one per mining algorithm, recording the
  last block that used it. It cost 64 bytes for every one of the chain's 24
  million headers, and two of its eight slots were for algorithms that were
  never switched on. It is gone. The two places that read it now use the same
  walk the difficulty rules have always used for everything else.

  The saving was measured three independent ways that agree within one per cent:
  the block header record read out of each compiled binary, 208 bytes before and
  144 after; 1.56 GB less on a real synced mainnet node, which is 14 per cent of
  everything that node was holding; and 62.9 bytes saved per block on the real
  test network chain reindexed from the first block, against the 64 bytes
  predicted.

  **The cost.** Startup takes about two and a half seconds longer on a mainnet
  node, out of roughly two minutes. That is a real cost, paid on every start.
  **Connecting blocks shows no measurable difference.** Three hundred blocks
  were taken off and put back again, five rounds a start, two starts a build, on
  a copy of the real mainnet chain; the spread from one run to the next is
  twenty times larger than anything this change could contribute.

  The cost exists because the deleted array answered "which was the previous
  block using this mining algorithm" in one jump, and the node now walks back
  down the chain to find it. On mainnet the five algorithms are mined evenly, so
  that walk averages under five steps. On the test network one algorithm can go
  a long time without a block, and the same walk averages 127 steps, which is
  why the test network shows a much larger slowdown than mainnet does.

  **An earlier figure was wrong and is withdrawn.** A first measurement said
  startup got 3 to 4 per cent faster. A second measurement, with timing code
  compiled into both builds, re-split those same runs and found the difference
  was well inside the noise. Startup is slightly slower, not faster, and the two
  and a half seconds above is the figure to use.

  **Difficulty is unchanged.** The walk that remains is byte for byte the code
  that was already there. Before the array was deleted, the two lookups were run
  side by side over every mining algorithm, every difficulty rule, every era and
  the minimum-difficulty special case, and their answers were written down as
  plain numbers that the tests still check. The node reports exactly the same
  difficulty for all five algorithms on mainnet and on the test network, and
  reaches exactly the same chain tip. Nothing on disk changed: the stored block
  record never held these pointers.

- **Routine DigiDollar and oracle log lines are quiet by default.** Three lines
  were written for every transaction on every node regardless of settings. They
  are gone, and routine DigiDollar and oracle messages now need
  `-debug=digidollar`. Errors, warnings and startup progress are still shown
  without it. One line is a known exception and still prints without the
  category: a note that an owner key is already saved, written when a wallet is
  paid DigiDollar at one of its own addresses. Anything that reads the log for
  routine DigiDollar lines has to add the category.

- **Coin scans use a compact, sorted copy of changed cache entries** alongside
  the database records. This replaces the extra hash table used in an earlier
  version of the new accounting code. The scan still copies the changed coins
  so later cache reads cannot disturb it, and uses their newer values in place
  of the saved versions.

- **Mining no longer grinds at the block before Thaw Day.** The starting
  accounting record is built once, when the block is really connected, instead
  of once for every block template a miner asks for.

Startup and recovery
--------------------

- **Startup does not repeat oracle work it has already done**, and reuses parsed
  bundles instead of parsing them again.

- **A long DigiDollar rebuild reports progress and can be cancelled.** A scan
  that is interrupted no longer publishes half-finished figures. The new
  canonical recovery starts when the next block reaches Thaw Day. Existing
  DigiDollar startup reconstruction still runs on DigiDollar-active chains
  below that height, including when Thaw Day is not scheduled.

- **A pruned node keeps the block history validation needs.** See section 1
  above.

Tests, tools and documents
---------------------------

- `decoderawtransaction` and `getrawtransaction` work on DigiDollar transactions
  on a node started with `-rpcdoccheck`, and their help lists the DigiDollar
  fields they return. They could not before, so no test could decode one.
- Two inherited pruning tests now build ordinary pre-DigiDollar history first,
  so they can test pruning on a chain where DigiDollar starts at the first
  block.
- Seven unit tests no longer pass or fail depending on which directory the test
  program was started from.
- The anchors test writes a port with its leading zero, so it no longer reports
  a false failure on a machine using low port numbers.
- The operator, wallet, exchange and oracle guides are updated.
- Oracle display names come from each network's roster. Mainnet ID 0 shows
  "DigiByte.Io Oracle" and ID 11 shows "Crypto Corner Shop". This is local
  display text only. Oracle IDs, keys, ordering, signatures and quorum are
  unchanged, and nothing about what is signed or sent over the wire changed.


For exchanges and custody
=========================

- **The four amount commands are the breaking change.** See section 2. Check
  every script before you upgrade.
- **Circulating supply can now report that it is unknown** instead of returning
  an unreliable number. `getdigidollarstats` returns an error when historical
  amounts cannot be recovered reliably. The text differs between the legacy
  and Thaw Day paths. Treat this as unavailable supply. Do not treat it as zero.
- **Open vault principal is reported separately from circulating tokens.**
  `getdigidollarstats` reports `open_vault_principal`, and
  `selected_health_denominator` says which of the two the health figure was
  computed from. At and above Thaw Day it is `open_vault_principal`; below it,
  `legacy_supply`.
- Extra burns can leave fewer circulating tokens than open vault principal. With
  the same collateral, that can lower health, prolong a restriction on minting,
  or raise the DigiDollar needed to redeem. Thaw Day itself creates no tokens
  and changes no wallet balance.
- **Leftover DigiByte from a redemption no longer follows a redemption address
  you supply.** If you pass a deposit address for the returned collateral, the
  change after the fee stays in the sending wallet, and the redemption stops
  with an error rather than sending the change somewhere the wallet cannot
  reach.


For miners and pools
====================

Nothing in this release changes difficulty or the block reward.

The Thaw Day rule changes are gated on each network's height. Mainnet uses
24,490,000 and testnet26 uses 432,100. Signet is unsupported and remains
unscheduled. Blocks below a scheduled height retain their existing validation
rules, including during reindex.
An earlier testnet reindex reached the recorded height and hash. That result
applies to its tested build and history. The final-build mainnet reindex still
needs to be completed.

Once the scheduled height is reached, a block that mints DigiDollar is
checked against a price taken from the chain rather than from each node's own
state. A miner still running old software after that height can build blocks the
rest of the network rejects. Plan to upgrade before the height, not after it.


What has been checked, and what has not
=======================================

Each candidate needs its own verification record. That record must identify the
source commit, binary hashes, build options, tests run, skipped tests, and
unresolved findings. Results from an earlier build do not establish that RC2
passed. Publish the completed record with the tested candidate.

Controlled regtest coverage includes Thaw Day activation, restart, reindex,
reorgs, and separate token and vault accounting. A public testnet reindex checks
the history available at its recorded height. Mainnet Thaw Day is scheduled
at 24,490,000 and testnet26 at 432,100. Public Thaw Day activation and sustained
network observation have not been completed for this candidate.

Before the final mainnet release, complete the final-build mainnet history
reindex, coordinated public testnet activation and observation, required platform
checks, and final independent review. A local candidate test run does not finish
those release gates.

Passing a reindex is evidence about the tested build and the recorded history.
It does not prove how every possible future block will behave.

RC2 record, source commit `653484decd` with the version bump on top: 3,742 unit
tests passed with none failed; 396 extended functional tests passed with 17
skipped and none failed; the desktop wallet tests passed. The isolated Thaw Day
lab exercise `rc2-rehearsal-09` crossed Thaw Day at a lab height of 5,000, ran
every DigiDollar feature before and after it, including mints at all ten lock
tiers, transfers, every redemption path, the extra burn, the boundary reorg, a
wallet-holding node reindex, and a fresh empty node syncing from scratch, and
finished at height 5,658 with 143 recorded checks and no failures. The mainnet node
whose RC1 reindex had stopped at 23,869,548 accepted block 23,869,549 on RC2
after `reconsiderblock`, with its DigiDollar wallet loaded, and validated every
later block to the tip at 24,222,044 with no rejection. That covers the whole
DigiDollar era of mainnet on a wallet-holding node. The blocks below the
DigiDollar activation height were validated by the same node on RC1 and were
not validated again. Fuzz targets were not rerun for RC2.


Compatibility
=============

DigiByte Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the
Linux kernel, macOS 11.0 and newer, and Windows 7 and newer. It should work on
most other Unix-like systems but is not tested on them as often.

Notes for earlier releases are under `doc/release-notes/`.
